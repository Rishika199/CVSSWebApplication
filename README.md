you will find the following directories in there 1.dao(which will be used to perform crud operations in our database)
The model direcorty has mimicked the baseScore, Environmental Score & TemporalScore with it's attributes. And all of these are injected into the class CvssScore.
The resources directory has the necessary Rest Controller for our web Application which will direct and handle the requests as needed.
The Service directory has our sevices that we are going to provide such as generating Vector String, Calculating BaseScore,EnvironmentalScore,TemporalScore.
It would evolve more with time
